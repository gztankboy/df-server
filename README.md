受病役情况影响，广州IT的春节假期将会延期到二月九日,在此期间，IT将会尝试用远程桌面的方式提供有限的服务，但不能保证技术支援服务一定有效。
如一定需要同事回办公室才能进行的支援，也只是基于同事自愿的基础下进行，所以IT并不建议在此期间对有关项目进行上线。
如确定在此期间上线，需要相关团队的支持，也只能远程桌面进行，有可能会出现连接中断的问题而影响到发布中断，当发现错误出现的时候，需要rollback时，有可能远程桌面不能解决而由于回办公室需要时间，而导致到客服热线数量激增。


Affected by the situation of medical service, Guangzhou it's Spring Festival holiday will be extended to February 9. During this period, it will try to provide limited services by remote desktop, but it cannot guarantee that the technical support services will be effective.
If it is necessary for colleagues to return to the office for support, it is only based on their own willingness. Therefore, it is not recommended to launch related projects during this period.
If it is determined to go online during this period, it needs the support of relevant teams, and it can only be carried out by remote desktop, which may cause the connection interruption and affect the publishing interruption. When an error is found and a rollback is needed, it may be that the remote desktop cannot be solved and it will take time to return to the office, which will cause the number of customer service hotline to surge.
